## Setup and Run Instructions for Next.js App

**1. Clone or Download the Project**

If you have the project code in a Git repository, you can clone it using Git Bash or your preferred terminal application. Otherwise, download the project files and extract them to your desired location.

**2. Install Dependencies**

Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory using the `cd` command. Once you're in the project directory, run the following command to install all the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This command will download and install all the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file, including Next.js itself and other libraries your project uses.

**3. Development Server**

To start the development server and see your application running locally, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will typically start the server on port 3000 by default. You can access your application in the browser by visiting `http://localhost:3000`. 


By following these steps, you should be able to set up, run, and develop your Next.js application effectively.
